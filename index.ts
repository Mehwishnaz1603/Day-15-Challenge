//Q43: Unchanged Magicians: Start with your work from Exercise 40. Call the function 
//make_great() with a copy of the array of magiciansâ€™ names. Because the original 
//array will be unchanged, return the new array and store it in a separate array.

//names and one array with the Great added to each magicianâ€™s name.

//Q44: Sandwiches: Write a function that accepts a array of items a person wants on a
//sandwich. The function should have one parameter that collects as many items as
//the function call provides, and it should print a summary of the sandwich that 
//is being ordered. Call the function three times, using a different number of 
//arguments each time.
